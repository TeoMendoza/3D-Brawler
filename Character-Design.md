## Overview

3D Brawler features three unique fighters, each built around a distinct playstyle, consisting of a base attack, three core abilities, and a powerful ultimate ability. Their designs are intentionally interwoven in a rock-paper-scissors inspired framework: every character has specific strengths and vulnerabilities against each of the others.

This interplay creates a balanced ecosystem where no fighter is universally dominant. Success relies on reading matchups, mastering timing, and adapting to an opponent’s style. With the option to switch characters mid-match, battles naturally shift in pace and tone, ensuring gameplay remains skillful, varied, and engaging from start to finish.

## Characters

### The Magician
A theatrical villain who manipulates the battlefield with illusions, control effects, and deception. Once a beloved stage performer, he now twists his craft into a weapon. The Magician excels in close-range 1v1 duels, punishing overconfidence with tricks that disorient, misdirect, and shut down opponents. In free-for-all battles, he thrives on chaos, slipping in and out of sight while sowing confusion across the arena.  

#### Ability Set
- **Base Attack - Card Toss**: Throws razor-sharp playing cards one at a time in rapid succession, with eight cards per reload cycle.  
- **Ability 1 - Confusion Charm**: Launches a cursed card that, on hit, briefly reverses the target’s movement controls.  
- **Ability 2 - Black Dust**: Releases a puff of smoke in a forward cone. Enemies looking at The Magician are blinded, but those who turn away can avoid the effect.  
- **Ability 3 - Cloak and Sneak**: Shrouds himself in near-invisibility, leaving faint outlines and footprints. He remains able to attack and use abilities, forcing enemies to track him carefully.  
- **Ultimate - Final Act: Hypnotic Gaze**: Fixates on a single target with a hypnotic stare. If they keep him in sight while within his crosshair, they are stunned until they avert their gaze or he changes focus.  

#### Design Reasoning
- Strengths: Guerilla Tactics esq fighter, in and out, high pressure with good utility for gaining advantages close range. Very fast, mobile (non ability, just from a speed perspective), and tricky, high outplay potential. High punish capabilities & just very fast paced, does well in tricky map areas with fast movement speed and utility can be used to find space to use map for escapes/tricky plays.
- Weaknesses: Close range fighter, so mid to long range utility is minimal. A bit squishy in terms of health & defensive capabilties. Needs to force 1 on 1's, does not to well in nonisolated enviornments with many players. Also high skill ceiling, needs to use utility well and accurately to capitalize on the kit. Open areas are struggles due to lack of mobility abilties, no easy escapes. Must play around kit well.
- Design Intent: A high skilled, but extremeley powerful and aggresive duelist who tries to isolate 1 vs 1's and use his kit to create massive advantages and secure kills. Needs to have good game sense and map awareness/usage aswell, adding to the skill requirement. Additionally, a rewarding feeling for the high outplay potential and also the fun active chaotic feel the kit provides, paired with the fast paced nature of the game, feeling like an extremely active and action packed expirience/characfter
- Matchup Goals: Against a mirror matchup, it is dependent heavily on better mechanical skill, both from an aim perspective and ability usage. There can be scenarios where mirror matchups can start with advantages depending on the place and circumstances a fight happens in, but from an objective standpoint, it is a game of intelligence and skill. A common scenario will be who can strike first and more accurately, but there is still chances to use the map to ones advantage, additionally, knowing how to take a fight, dependent on where other players are, can change this matchup. Against The Hunter, The Magician will not be able to challenge the long range advantages The Hunter has, and will have to manuever carefully, avoiding the open spaces where the hunter thrives. The Magician is best using his abilities and time finding a way to get closer to the hunter, and turning the fight close range, or sneak attacking and using the utility to get a fast kill. Against the Monk, The Magician still attempts to get close, but can still play more forgivingly in a mid range given that the Monk is a medium damage character that cannot punish bad map usage as heavily. The Magician wants to play in the close-mid range, using utility to get damage but addtionally trying to bait out Monk utility before making an agressive jump to finish the fight. The Magician can additionaly do a sneak attack aswell with utility to try and get a fast kill. The different matchups provide multiple scenarios and ways of having to use the magician, ensuring that each scenario can be played differently. Additionally, with their being many players at once, multiple of these scenarios may overlap, causing the player to have to adjust and choose combinations or best choices out of many options.
