## Overview

3D Brawler features three unique fighters, each crafted with a distinct playstyle. Their designs are intentionally interwoven in a "rock–paper–scissors" inspired format; every character has particular strengths and vulnerabilities when facing each of the others. This creates a dynamic ecosystem where no fighter is universally dominant, and success depends on reading the matchup, mastering timing, and adapting to the opponent’s style.

The variety of arena environments adds another strategic layer, shifting advantages and forcing players to adjust tactics on the fly. Combined with the ability to switch characters mid-match, battles naturally evolve in pace and tone, keeping gameplay skillful, original, and exciting from start to finish.

A theatrical villain who manipulates the battlefield with mind games, illusions, and control effects.
