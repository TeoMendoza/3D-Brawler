## Overview

3D Brawler features three unique fighters, each built around a distinct playstyle, consisting of a base attack, three core abilities, and a powerful ultimate ability. Their designs are intentionally interwoven in a rock–paper–scissors inspired framework: every character has specific strengths and vulnerabilities against each of the others.

This interplay creates a balanced ecosystem where no fighter is universally dominant. Success relies on reading matchups, mastering timing, and adapting to an opponent’s style. With the option to switch characters mid-match, battles naturally shift in pace and tone, ensuring gameplay remains skillful, varied, and engaging from start to finish.

### The Magician
A theatrical villain who manipulates the battlefield with illusions, control effects, and deception. Once a beloved stage performer, he now twists his craft into a weapon.  The Magician excels in close-range 1v1 duels, punishing overconfidence with tricks that disorient, misdirect, and shut down opponents.  In free-for-all battles, he thrives on chaos, slipping in and out of sight while sowing confusion across the arena.  

- **Base Attack - Card Toss**: Throws razor-sharp playing cards one at a time in rapid succession, with eight cards per reload cycle.  
- **Ability 1 - Confusion Charm**: Launches a cursed card that, on hit, briefly reverses the target’s movement controls.  
- **Ability 2 – Black Dust**: Releases a puff of smoke in a forward cone. Enemies looking at The Magician are blinded, but those who turn away can avoid the effect.  
- **Ability 3 – Cloak and Sneak**: Shrouds himself in near-invisibility, leaving faint outlines and footprints. He remains able to attack and use abilities, forcing enemies to track him carefully.  
- **Ultimate – Final Act: Hypnotic Gaze**: Fixates on a single target with a hypnotic stare. If they keep him in sight while within his crosshair, they are stunned until they avert their gaze or he changes focus.  

### The Hunter
A calculated duelist who thrives on accuracy and controlling chokepoints. The Hunter is patient and deliberate, punishing poor movement with devastating follow-ups. While slower than most, his kit rewards precision and planning, making him dangerous in mid-range engagements.  

- **Base Attack – Double Shot Crossbow**: Fires two quick, high-damage bolts before reloading. Precision is key, a skilled player can finish opponents with accurate headshots.  
- **Ability 1 – Frost-Tipped Bolts**: Temporarily imbues next bolt with slowing effects, making it easier to punish poor positioning or set up follow-up shots.  
- **Ability 2 – Net Shot**: Launches a net that immobilizes the target on hit, leaving them exposed to precise follow-up attacks.  
- **Ability 3 – Scatter Shot**: Fires a powerful double-barrel shotgun blast at close range. Deals heavy damage up close, punishing enemies who push in, but can also be used offensively to finish weakened targets.  
- **Ultimate – Hunter’s Mark**: For a short duration, all enemies are revealed with glowing red outlines visible through terrain. While active, The Hunter’s movements become silent, allowing him to stalk and ambush prey with precision.  


### The Monk
A disciplined warrior who embodies adaptability, flowing between offense and defense with ease.  
The Monk excels at reactive play, using spiritual force to reposition, survive, or punish overextensions.  
He is versatile and reliable, dangerous in duels and capable of swinging chaotic fights back in his favor.  

- **Base Attack – Spirit Beads**: Tosses floating beads in a rhythmic sequence, returning over time.  
- **Ability 1 – Strengthen**: Briefly fortifies body and spirit, healing and reducing incoming damage.  
- **Ability 2 – Air Palm**: A forceful blast of wind that knocks enemies back, dealing extra damage if they collide with walls.  
- **Ability 3 – Cloud Step**: Launches upward and backward on a gust of spiritual energy, allowing quick escapes or aerial play.  
- **Ultimate – Harmony Break**: Transfers current health to all enemies in range, and gains the health of the highest-health enemy in range.
