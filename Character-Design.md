## Overview

3D Brawler features three unique fighters, each built around a distinct playstyle, consisting of a base attack, three core abilities, and a powerful ultimate ability. Their designs are intentionally interwoven in a rock-paper-scissors inspired framework: every character has specific strengths and vulnerabilities against each of the others.

This interplay creates a balanced ecosystem where no fighter is universally dominant. Success relies on reading matchups, mastering timing, and adapting to an opponent’s style. With the option to switch characters mid match, battles naturally shift in pace and tone, ensuring gameplay remains skillful, varied, and engaging from start to finish.

## Characters

### The Magician
A theatrical villain who manipulates the battlefield with illusions, control effects, and deception. Once a beloved stage performer, he now twists his craft into a weapon. The Magician excels in close range 1v1 duels, punishing overconfidence with tricks that disorient, misdirect, and shut down opponents. In free-for-all battles, he thrives on chaos, slipping in and out of sight while sowing confusion across the arena.  

#### Ability Set
- **Base Attack - Card Toss**: Throws razor sharp playing cards one at a time in rapid succession, with eight cards per reload cycle.  
- **Ability 1 - Confusion Charm**: Launches a cursed card that, on hit, briefly reverses the target’s movement controls.  
- **Ability 2 - Black Dust**: Releases a puff of smoke in a forward cone. Enemies looking at The Magician are blinded, but those who turn away can avoid the effect.  
- **Ability 3 - Cloak and Sneak**: Shrouds himself in near invisibility, leaving faint outlines and footprints. He remains able to attack and use abilities, forcing enemies to track him carefully.  
- **Ultimate - Final Act: Hypnotic Gaze**: Fixates on a single target with a hypnotic stare. If they keep him in sight while within his crosshair, they are stunned until they avert their gaze or he changes focus.  

#### Design Reasoning
- **Strengths**: The Magician is a guerilla style fighter built for constant pressure and opportunistic play. He thrives in close quarters duels where his high movement speed, disruptive utility, and trick based gameplay allow him to punish overextensions. His kit is fast paced and rewards sharp timing, map awareness, and creativity. In the right hands, he can turn even small advantages into decisive kills and dominate chaotic fights by disorienting opponents.  

- **Weaknesses**: His kit is heavily range restricted, mid to long distance engagements expose his lack of reach and defensive tools. With low durability and no instant escape options, The Magician must commit to fights carefully. He struggles in wide, open arenas where cover is sparse and cannot rely on raw stats to survive. His effectiveness depends on precision use of his abilities and a strong grasp of positioning, making him punishing for players who mismanage his tools.  

- **Design Intent**: The Magician is meant to embody the “high skill, high reward” archetype. He is a fast, aggressive duelist who isolates enemies into 1v1 scenarios and overwhelms them with misdirection and control effects. Success with him requires both mechanical skill (aim and ability accuracy) and mental acuity (reading the map, anticipating movement, and timing attacks). Players who master his toolkit will feel rewarded with stylish, high impact outplays and an intensely active playstyle that complements the game’s frenetic pace.  

- **Matchup Goals**:  
   - **Mirror Match - Skill vs. Skill:** Whoever uses terrain, timing, and accuracy better wins. Situational advantages like high ground or surprise angles often decide the fight.  
  - **Versus The Hunter - Close The Gap:** The Magician can’t contest long range firepower; he must use stealth, map cover, and sudden bursts to ambush and finish quickly.  
  - **Versus The Monk - Bait Then Strike:** The Monk’s mid range toolkit is less punishing, so The Magician can pressure, bait cooldowns, and commit once openings appear.  
  - **Free For All Context - Adapt To Chaos:** With multiple enemies, he must constantly shift targets and weave tricks into the arena’s disorder, ensuring no two fights play out the same.

### The Hunter

A calculated duelist who thrives on accuracy and controlling chokepoints. The Hunter is patient and deliberate, punishing poor movement with devastating follow-ups. While slower than most, his kit rewards precision and planning, making him dangerous in mid range engagements.  

#### Ability Set
- **Base Attack - Double Shot Crossbow**: Fires two quick, high damage bolts before reloading. Precision is key, a skilled player can finish opponents with accurate headshots.  
- **Ability 1 - Frost-Tipped Bolts**: Temporarily imbues next bolt with slowing effects, making it easier to punish poor positioning or set up follow-up shots.  
- **Ability 2 - Net Shot**: Launches a net that immobilizes the target on hit, leaving them exposed to precise follow-up attacks.  
- **Ability 3 - Scatter Shot**: Fires a powerful double barrel shotgun blast at close range. Deals heavy damage up close, punishing enemies who push in, but can also be used offensively to finish weakened targets.  
- **Ultimate - Hunter’s Mark**: For a short duration, all enemies are revealed with glowing red outlines visible through terrain. While active, The Hunter’s movements become silent, allowing him to stalk and ambush prey with precision.  

#### Design Reasoning
- **Strengths**: The Hunter is a high damage, aim rewarding character who excels at mid to long range combat. He can eliminate enemies quickly with precise shots, punishing even small mistakes. His utility creates windows for guaranteed follow-ups, and his relatively high health gives him a bit more forgiveness than other ranged specialists. He thrives in open spaces and chokepoints, where his ability to control angles makes him devastating.  

- **Weaknesses**: Despite his durability, The Hunter is slow and immobile, with no reliable movement abilities. His effectiveness depends on exceptional aim and accuracy, as his crossbow has a small clip and little margin for error. Poor positioning can be brutally punished, and unlike more technical fighters, his kit doesn’t compensate for lapses in awareness or aim. He is unforgiving for players who lack strong game sense and map control.  

- **Design Intent**: The Hunter represents the “precision and patience” archetype. He is less about flashy outplays and more about disciplined positioning, controlled aim, and smart decision making. His goal is to stay at range, control key areas of the map, and punish reckless movement. In the right hands, he embodies the satisfaction of the “sniper fantasy,” rewarding accuracy and foresight with crushing impact. Players who master him feel empowered by dominating the battlefield through control, timing, and perfect shots.  

- **Matchup Goals**:  
  - **Mirror Match - Aim Decides The Duel:** With both Hunters playing at range, the outcome comes down to accuracy and positioning. Whoever minimizes openings while creating cleaner sightlines will gain the edge.  
  - **Versus The Magician - Keep Him At Bay:** The Hunter must punish Magician’s attempts to close distance, anticipating stealth approaches and repositioning to maintain range. He can also exploit chokepoints, baiting aggression and countering with Scatter Shot to punish Magician’s low health if forced into close quarters.  
  - **Versus The Monk - Control Space, Deny Pressure:** Monk has more tools for mid range play and fewer situational weaknesses, giving him answers in nearly every scenario. The Hunter must play smart, capitalizing on utility (like Net Shot) to lock Monk down. Unlike other matchups, Monk’s timed reload mechanic denies natural “windows” to punish, so success requires reading attack rhythms and striking at opportune moments.  
  - **Free For All Context - Pick From Safety:** The Hunter thrives when staying out of the central chaos, instead racking up damage and kills from safe vantage points. Awareness is key: he must punish overextensions while knowing when to disengage and reposition to avoid being collapsed on.

### The Monk

A disciplined warrior who embodies adaptability, flowing between offense and defense with ease. The Monk excels at reactive play, using spiritual force to reposition, survive, or punish overextensions. He is versatile and reliable, dangerous in duels and capable of swinging chaotic fights back in his favor.  

#### Ability Set
- **Base Attack - Spirit Beads**: Tosses floating beads in a rhythmic sequence. Ammo replenishes automatically over time, keeping the Monk in constant flow.  
- **Ability 1 - Strengthen**: Restores health through spiritual focus. Heals instantly with a lingering effect over time, allowing him to endure and recover in the midst of battle.  
- **Ability 2 - Air Palm**: Releases a forceful blast of wind that knocks enemies back and briefly stuns them. Deals extra damage if enemies collide with walls, making it especially dangerous in tight spaces.  
- **Ability 3 - Cloud Step**: Launches upward on a gust of spiritual energy, gaining height and then steering freely while airborne. Can be used defensively to escape pressure or offensively for aerial positioning.  
- **Ultimate - Harmony Break**: Swaps health across the field: all enemies in range have their health set to the Monk’s current value, and the Monk’s health becomes the highest among those affected.
