## Overview

3D Brawler is a fast-paced, skill-driven free-for-all arena fighter where up to 8–12 players collide in chaotic, ever-shifting battlegrounds. The game emphasizes mechanical precision and strategic decision making, while staying accessible and non-punishing through rapid respawns. This balance encourages bold plays, constant action, and high energy moments throughout every match.

Progress is measured through a dynamic scoring system that tracks multiple performance factors, including kills, damage dealt, kill streaks, and survival time. This approach rewards diverse playstyles: dominating through eliminations, applying consistent pressure, or excelling in survivability. Victory comes not just from landing final blows, but from consistently performing across all aspects of combat.

Though combat is grounded in realistic physics, variety emerges from both character abilities and the arenas themselves. Each stage introduces unique dynamics that shape fights in different ways, creating opportunities for creative positioning, improvisation, and dramatic comebacks. The result is gameplay that feels unpredictable, chaotic, and deeply skillful, ensuring no two matches ever play out the same.
