## Game Premise
A fast-paced, skill-based free-for-all brawler where up to 8–10 players clash in chaotic arenas.  
The game emphasizes **mechanical skill and decision-making**, but remains **non-punishing** thanks to quick respawns.  
This balance encourages players to take risks, push aggressive plays, and create constant moments of excitement.  

While combat is grounded in **realistic physics**, the variety of abilities and movement options ensures unpredictable and chaotic battles.  
Players must learn not only how to outplay their opponents, but also how to adapt to the shifting pace of the arena.
